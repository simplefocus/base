A nifty way to start a project.  This assumes you have Compass and Foundation installed locally.

For Compass, you can use CodeKit (http://incident57.com/codekit)

#### For Foundation: (from foundation.zurb.com) ####

`[sudo] gem install zurb-foundation`

#### Adding Foundation to an existing Compass project ####

1. Add `require "zurb-foundation"` to your config.rb file
2. cd path/to/your-project
3. run `compass install foundation`
